# Downloading and Running a Java Application

## Step 1: Downloading the Repository

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unintellectual/Calculator).
2. Click on the green "Code" button on the right side of the page.

    - **Download ZIP**: Click on "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a compressed ZIP file. Once downloaded, extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

    - **Using Git (recommended)**: If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the repository using the following command:

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Unintellectual/Calculator.git
      ```

## Step 2: Compiling and Running the Application

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:

    - If you don't have the JDK installed, you can download it from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or from an alternative source like OpenJDK.

2. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**:

    - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the ZIP file or cloned the repository using the `cd` command. For example:

      ```
      cd /path/to/Calculator
      ```

3. **Compile the Java Code**:

    - Find the Java source files (`.java` files) in the repository. There might be a main class (typically with a `public static void main(String[] args)` method) that you need to run.

    - Compile the Java code using the `javac` command followed by the name of the main Java file. For example:

      ```
      javac Main.java
      ```

      This will generate the corresponding `.class` files.

4. **Run the Application**:

    - Once the code is compiled successfully, you can run the application using the `java` command followed by the name of the main class (without the file extension). For example:

      ```
      java Main
      ```

      This command should start the calculator application.

### Additional Notes:

- Make sure that the repository contains a Java source
=======
Go to the GitHub repository.

Click on the green "Code" button on the right side of the page.

You have two options:

a. Download ZIP: Click on "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a compressed ZIP file. Once downloaded, extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

b. Using Git (recommended): If you have Git installed on your system, you can clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Unintellectual/Calculator.git
Step 2: Compiling and Running the Application
Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

If you don't have the JDK installed, you can download it from the official Oracle website or from an alternative source like OpenJDK.
Open a Terminal/Command Prompt:

Navigate to the directory where you extracted the ZIP file or cloned the repository using the cd command. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/Calculator
Compile the Java Code:

Find the Java source files (.java files) in the repository. There might be a main class (typically with a public static void main(String[] args) method) that you need to run.

Compile the Java code using the javac command followed by the name of the main Java file. For example:

css
Copy code
javac Main.java
This will generate the corresponding .class files.

Run the Application:

Once the code is compiled successfully, you can run the application using the java command followed by the name of the main class (without the file extension). For example:
css
Copy code
java Main
This command should start the calculator application.

Additional Notes:
Make sure that the repository contains a Java source file with a public static void main(String[] args) method. This is typically the entry point of a Java application.

If there are any additional libraries or dependencies required, the repository might contain instructions on how to set them up. Check for a README file or any provided documentation in the repository.

If the application requires any specific command-line arguments, make sure to pass them when running the Java application.

If you encounter any specific issues or error messages while compiling or running the Java application, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
